### Github Finder

Exploring the latest React additions using hooks and the ContextAPI while completing the React Front to Back 2019 Course by Traversy Media for React Certification.  Built a very simple react application, initially with the traditional React stateful components and managing state changes with props (prop drilling), and once completed, refactored the app to all functional components to use the useState and useEffect methods to simplify the code. When that was fully functioning, it is refactored a third time using React's contextAPI.
